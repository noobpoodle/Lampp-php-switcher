"Can you please explain how"-

Of course, it really is simple., I'll put an example after explaining, because these scripts can version any Lampp stack actually..

  All we are doing here is using our default install at /opt/lampp as a master to contain different versioned binaries within /bin
First we rename that master install

Then we create a new install, some thing like 7.0.1 may have wildly different php binaries than 5, but after the rename, and new
install, we want to note that version

So /opt/lampp is your new install now
Take a breather, note the version of it's new binaries (like php-7.0.1) within /bin, and run copier using that as the first param, 
and a reference to our temp master

In my example my master was originally a version 5.2.63 or similar, so I named it /opt/lampp5, ran sudo ./lampp_copier.sh 7.0.1 5
and voila binaries are copied over

But this isn't how they are referenced in /bin, thanksfully that is done by default, by symlink, so now rename everything back and
use your master /opt/lampp install


Note that copier .sh will backup existing libphp modules, and copy any latest versions which may or not be referenced properly inside /opt/lampp/etc/extra/ conf

That one we want to now run that new version parameter against using switcher, such as this way, ran sudo ./lampp_switcher.sh 7.0.1
And you know what, it's intuitive

It will create sym links, if you use a bad version and they end up broken, fix your parameter and run again, it fixes each on exit 1
Ultimately you're versioned and gtg!


I much rather prefer this way especially in the spirit of the old xampp phpswitcher.bat for Windows and in the spirit of Github.,
version and create your stack.

Manage, maintain your running xampp, httpd before these actions, so no PIDs are left hanging, you just upgraded php, and can switch back and forth.

Trust that any modules are copied (see latest script output) and verify your versioning, upgrade or downgrade by httpd-xampp stored in /etc/extra



LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so   or change to 5, 7   if needed manually before sudo ./opt/lampp/xampp start
